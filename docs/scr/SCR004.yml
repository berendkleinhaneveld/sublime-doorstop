  When running the command, a list of documents is shown
  that the user can filter by typing.

  Once the user selects a document from the list, all items
  from that document will be displayed in a list, with the
  document prefix and either the header or the first line of
  the text attribute. Here, the user can type to quickly
  filter the list and open the desired item.
