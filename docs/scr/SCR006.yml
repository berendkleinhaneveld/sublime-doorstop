  Links are represented in doorstop as an entry in a child item
  that points to a parent item. The parent item does not contain
  content that points to child items.

  Therefore the attribute 'links' is highlighted and when the user
  hovers the mouse over the attribute, a list of links is displayed
  that the user can click to quicly navigate to the clicked item.
