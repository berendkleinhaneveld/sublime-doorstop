  The user shall be able to quickly navigate to child doorstop
  items (items that have the current item as their parent).

  This works as:

  * List of links on hover over 'links' attribute
  * Doorstop command palette: Doorstop: GoTo Child
      * When multiple children exist, show interactive list
      * List shows: item id + header/1st line of text

  TODO: split into two items
