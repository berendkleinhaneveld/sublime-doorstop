  User shall be able to navigate docs with search

  Sublime Text allows for quickly switching files, but only based
  on filenames. There should be a kind of switcher that uses a
  search phrase from the user to filter doorstop documents.

  Example: CMD+SHIFT+R

  * Command palette: Doorstop: Search
