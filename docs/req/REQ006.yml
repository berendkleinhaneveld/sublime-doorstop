  User shall be able to navigate to child item(s)

  When the user has a doorstop item open, then there shall
  be a way for the user to quickly navigate to child doorstop
  items (items that have the current item as their parent).

  This might work as:

  * List of links on hover over 'links' attribute
  * Doorstop command palette: Doorstop: GoTo Child
      * When multiple children exist, show interactive list
      * List shows: item id + header/1st line of text
