  User shall be able to navigate to references

  Doorstop items can contain references to arbitrary files,
  which should be easy for the user to follow.

  Works as:

  * Mouse hover with link (done)
  * Command palette: Doorstop: GoTo Reference (todo)
      * When more than one reference: show list
