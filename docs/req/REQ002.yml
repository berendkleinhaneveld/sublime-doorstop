  User shall be able to create references

  When the user highlights some text in a file, then the user
  shall be able to run a command to copy a 'doorstop' reference
  dict.

  Fancy version would actually ask the user to search for an item
  to add the reference to. Search would include doorstop document
  paths and header/text content.

  * Command palette: Doorstop: copy reference
  * Command palette: Doorstop: create reference
      * Ask user to search for doorstop item to add reference to
